Adding filters to Splunk dashboards allows users to interactively explore and analyze data in real-time, providing valuable insights that can help with troubleshooting, monitoring, and decision-making.

Here are some of the main reasons why filters are commonly used in Splunk dashboards:

    Data Analysis: Filters allow users to slice and dice data in multiple ways, enabling them to identify patterns, trends, and anomalies that might otherwise be difficult to detect. By adding filters to a dashboard, users can quickly focus on specific data subsets and drill down into the details to gain a deeper understanding of the data.

    Data Visualization: Filters allow users to create dynamic visualizations that can be customized in real-time. By adding filters to a visualization, users can easily modify the data displayed in the visualization to create different views of the data and facilitate data exploration.

    Data Management: Filters allow users to easily manage large volumes of data and reduce noise. By adding filters to a dashboard, users can exclude irrelevant data from the display and focus on the data that is most relevant to their analysis.

    Collaboration: Filters can help facilitate collaboration between different teams working on a common problem. By adding filters to a dashboard, users can share their analysis with others and allow them to interact with the data in real-time, enabling a more collaborative approach to problem-solving.

Overall, adding filters to Splunk dashboards provides users with a powerful and flexible tool for data exploration and analysis, helping them to quickly identify and understand trends and patterns in their data.

#!/bin/bash
for i in {1..5}
do
   Replace <JENKINS_JOB_NAME> with the actual name of your Jenkins job
   curl -X POST https://<JENKINS_SERVER>/job/<JENKINS_JOB_NAME>/build --user <JENKINS_USERNAME>:<JENKINS_API_TOKEN>
done


Here's how to use the script:

    Replace <JENKINS_JOB_NAME> with the actual name of your Jenkins job.
    Replace <JENKINS_SERVER> with the URL of your Jenkins server.
    Replace <JENKINS_USERNAME> with your Jenkins username.
    Replace <JENKINS_API_TOKEN> with your Jenkins API token. You can find your API token in your Jenkins user profile.

Save the script as a file, e.g. run-jenkins-job.sh, and make it executable by running the following 
command:
chmod +x run-jenkins-job.sh

Then, run the script by running the following command:
dot/run-jenkins-job.sh

#!/bin/bash

#Define variables
jenkins_url="http://<jenkins-server>:<port>/"
job_name="<job-name>"
username="<jenkins-username>"
api_token="<jenkins-api-token>"
num_of_runs=5

# Loop through the number of runs and trigger the Jenkins job each time
for i in $(seq 1 $num_of_runs); do
    curl -X POST "${jenkins_url}/job/${job_name}/build" \
    --user "${username}:${api_token}" \
    --header "Jenkins-Crumb:<jenkins-crumb>"
done

Here's how to use the script:

    Replace <jenkins-server> and <port> with the URL and port of your Jenkins server, respectively.
    Replace <job-name> with the name of the Jenkins job that you want to trigger.
    Replace <jenkins-username> with your Jenkins username.
    Replace <jenkins-api-token> with your Jenkins API token. You can find your API token in your Jenkins user profile.
    Replace <jenkins-crumb> with the crumb that Jenkins uses to prevent cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks. You can obtain the crumb value by making a GET request to the Jenkins /crumbIssuer/api/xml endpoint. The value will be returned in the crumb field of the response.

Save the script as a file, e.g. run-jenkins-job.sh, and make it executable by running the following command:
chmod +x run-jenkins-job.sh

Then, run the script by running the following command:
./run-jenkins-job.sh

# Define variables

num_of_runs=5

# Loop through the number of runs and trigger the Jenkins job each time
for i in $(seq 1 $num_of_runs); do
    curl -X POST "${jenkins_url}"
done


Here's how to use the script:

    Replace <jenkins-server> and <port> with the URL and port of your Jenkins server, respectively.
    Replace <job-name> with the name of the Jenkins job that you want to trigger.
    Replace param1=value1&param2=value2 with the parameters and their values that your Jenkins job expects. If your Jenkins job doesn't expect any parameters, you can remove this part of the URL.
    Replace num_of_runs with the number of times you want to trigger the Jenkins job.

Save the script as a file, e.g. run-jenkins-job.sh, and make it executable by running the following command:
chmod +x run-jenkins-job.sh

Then, run the script by running the following command:
./run-jenkins-job.sh

curl -X POST https://jenkins.example.com/job/MyJob/build --user user:password
